## 🧪 Usage Example

### ✍️ Journal Entry Prompt:
I’ve been feeling overwhelmed with school and unsure if I’m making the right choices.


### 📝 GPT Reflection:
> It sounds like you're navigating a period of uncertainty. That’s completely normal, especially with major life decisions. Take a moment to reflect on what feels meaningful to you. You're doing your best.

### 😊 Sentiment Analysis:
- **Polarity (positivity)**: -0.15  
- **Subjectivity**: 0.85

### 🧘 Mindfulness Response:
> Take a deep breath. You are not alone in feeling this way. Try grounding yourself with a short walk, journaling a gratitude list, or practicing deep breathing.
